# GG-Case-Project

Quick note: Since it was not specified how long should the shuffle effect go for, I padded the animation with the same locked skins' highlights to the count of skins, hence making each animation the same length. This however had the weird effect where when only one of the skins is left, it highlights for the same duration by itself, before unlocking.
